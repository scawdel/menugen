Introduction
------------

  MenuGen provides a means of building RISC OS menus into a form of "Template
  File" which can be loaded into an application's workspace and passed
  directly to "Wimp_CreateMenu".  Items such as indirected data buffers are
  handled automatically.



Using MenuGen
-------------



Menu Definition Files
---------------------

  Menu definition files consist of a text file containing a series of
  commands.  The syntax is C-like, so that commands are terminated with
  semi-colons and nested with braces ('{' and '}').  Comments can be included
  in the files by enclosing them within "/*" and "*/".

  Files are case sensitive, and commands are always in lower case.

  The top-level of a file consists of one or more "menu" commands, each
  followed by a nested block containing its definition.

  menu (tag, "title")

    The "menu" command defines a new, empty menu.  It takes two parameters:

    * "tag" is a alphanumeric tag, which will be used to identify the menu
      within MenuGen.  It can not contian spaces.
    * "title" is the menu title.  If longer than 12 characters, it will
      automatically become indirected.

    The "menu" command can be followed by a block, containing the menu
    definition; if it is not, a default menu containing a single empty item
    will be created.


  Menu commands
  -------------

  The "menu" command can be followed by a block, containing one or more of
  the following commands to define the menu.  If it is not, or if any
  commands are omitted, defaults are used which conform to the Style Guide; a
  menu really needs at least one "item", otherwise it will be of little use.

  colours (title_fg, title_bg, work_fg, work_bg)

    In the context of a "menu" command, the "colours" sets the colours of the
    menu in terms of the standard Wimp colours 0 to 16.  Its parameters are:

    * "title_fg" is the title foreground colour.
    * "title_bg" is the title background colour.
    * "work_fg" is the work area foreground colour.
    * "work_bg" is the work area background colour.

    If omitted, the standard defaults of (7, 2, 7, 0) are used.

  indirected (length)

    In the context of a "menu" command, the "indirected" sets the title to be
    indirected with the specified space reserved.  If the title given in the
    "menu" command itself was longer than 12 characters it will already be
    indirected, but the command can still be used to set the amount of space
    reserved.

    * "length" specifies the number of characters to allocate, not including
      the string terminator.

    If omitted, titles of 12 characters or less will be non-indirected and
    those that are longer will only have buffers of the original length
    allocated.

  item ("text")

    The "item" command defines a new menu item: each "menu" command can
    contain one or more, which will be taken in the order they appear.  It
    takes one parameter:

    * "text" is the menu item text.  If longer than 12 characters, it will
      automatically become indirected.

    The "item" command can optionally be followed by a block containing more
    details; if it is not, a default text entry is created which conforms to
    the Style Guide.

  item_gap (gap)

    The "item_gap" sets the space between menu items, in OS units.

    * "gap" specifies the space between menu items, in OS units.

    If omitted, the gap is a standard 0 units.

  item_height (height)

    The "item_height" sets the height of the menu items, in OS units.

    * "height" specifies the item height, in OS units.

    If omitted, the height is a standard 44 units.

  reverse

    The "reverse" sets the menu to appear reversed (opening right to left).

    It is not implemented in this version of MenuGen, and menus always open
    left to right.
